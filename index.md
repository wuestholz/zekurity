subtitle: "Designing Revolutionary Fuzzers for Mission-Critical Zero-Knowledge Infrastructure"

🚨 **Problem**: Industry adoption of Zero-knowledge (ZK) technology is growing, but **latent soundness and completeness bugs** pose an existential **financial and reputational risk** for widespread success and adoption.

🧩 **Challenge**: These bugs are particularly challenging to detect due to the **inherent complexity** and **sophisticated optimizations** present in state-of-the-art ZK stacks (ZK DSL, zkVMs, etc.).

🔨 **Solution**: Our **pioneering fuzzers** specifically target this class of critical bugs and have already demonstrated their effectiveness by **finding more than 25 bugs** in widely-used systems, such as **Circom, Corset, Jolt, Gnark, Nexus, Noir, and RISC Zero**.

📢 Reach out to discuss how we can keep your mission-critical ZK infrastructure safe!

## About

**Established in 2023** by **Maria Christakis** ([TU Wien](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at)) and **Valentin Wüstholz** ([Diligence Security](https://consensys.net/diligence)), the ZeKurity Research Center is a joint initiative to address one of the biggest hurdles for widespread adoption of ZK systems: **critical bugs that pose existential financial and reputational risk** for developers and users.

Our **mission** is to develop effective techniques for detecting such critical bugs in complex ZK stacks that are **challenging to detect using traditional security processes**, such as manual audits and bug-bounty programs, or even more experimental and expensive processes, such as formal verification.

We have pioneered how to use fuzzing, a well-established security technique, to find the most elusive class of bugs in ZK technology stacks.
