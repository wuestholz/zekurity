subtitle: "Fuzzing for Mission-Critical Zero-Knowledge Infrastructure"
---

🚨 **Problem**: Industry adoption of Zero-knowledge (ZK) technology is growing, but **latent soundness and completeness bugs** pose an existential **financial and reputational risk** for widespread success and adoption.

🧩 **Challenge**: **Preventing such critical bugs** is one of the biggest challenges, especially due to the **inherent complexity** in many ZK components and the **sophisticated optimizations** that are necessary for many advanced ZK applications (ZK DSL, zkVMs, etc.).

🔨 **Solution**: Our **pioneering fuzzers** specifically target this class of critical bugs and have already demonstrated their effectiveness by **finding more than 25 bugs** in widely-used systems, such as **Circom, Corset, Jolt, Gnark, Nexus, Noir, and RISC Zero**.

## About

**Established in 2023**, the ZeKurity Research Center is a **joint initiative** between [**Diligence Security**](https://consensys.net/diligence) and [**TU Wien**](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at) to address one of the biggest hurdles for widespread adoption of ZK applications: **critical bugs that pose existential financial and reputational risk for developers and users**.

Our **mission** is to develop effective techniques for detecting such critical bugs in complex ZK components that are **challenging to detect using traditional security processes**, such as manual audits and bug-bounty programs, or even more experimental and expensive processes, such as formal verification.

We have pioneered how to use fuzzing, a well-established security technique, to find the most elusive class of bugs in ZK technology stacks.
